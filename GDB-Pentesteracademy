1. Compile the C file with -g (which is default option is also equivalent to g2) 

we can also compile with g3 which sets more debug points 

2. We can copy debug symbols to a different file with 'objcopy'

objcopy --only-keep-debug compiled-file object-file-to-be-created


3. We can also strip the compiled file from the debug sumbols with 'strip' tool

  strip --strip-debug --strip-unneeded 
  
  strip-unneeded is used to strip off all debug symbols and is useful in production environment

4. To add debug symbols to a file use 'objcopy'

objcopy --add-gnu-debug=Debug-file new-file

5. after compiling the C file with -g option we open it with gdb and can use the following options

info sources 
info variables (this doesnot show local variables)
info scope function (to find local variables) 
info functions


6.
