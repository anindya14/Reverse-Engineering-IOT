#Lzma

lzma -d filename.lzma often gives corrupt error and that is because The error found is due to 
LZMA Utils having been superseded by XV Utils, which don't ignore the trailing garbage. 
If you use it as a stream (like I gave you), you'll still have the corruption error message in the end, but you'll get your file alright.
and wont work for that use the following command

lzma -d < filename.lzma > filename
